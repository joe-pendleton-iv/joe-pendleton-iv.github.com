<p>
I am Joe Mother, and the only way I can describe the inner workings of my mind is an Nvidia RTX 3090 running on 2MB of RAM. I like taking things apart and sometimes putting them back together. I also collect old video game stuff.

Violence is also cool, like punting small babies, but you know what isn't cool? People who can't take a joke and report me to the counseler because I said I like kicking babies.

COUGH BRIGGS COUGH
